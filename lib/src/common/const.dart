  "Yes. I just emphasize that the use of Photoshop, for non-users, becomes difficult to follow. What requires a course to master it. Safe and very didactic teacher.",
  "I haven't finished the course yet, as I would like to have some feedback from the teacher, about the comments I shared on the forum 3 months ago, and I still haven't had any answer. I think the course is well structured, however the explanations and videos are very quick for beginners. However, it is good to go practicing."
